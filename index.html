    <p>Hi there, I'm Daniel Lu and a 2nd year masters student at UC Santa Barbara. I'm from Easy Bay Area but I've actually moved around alot and have a long history for each place. I was originally born in North Carolina and lived there for 5 years as my parents were completing their postdoc program there. Then I moved to New Jersey and lived there for 9 years which is where I spent the most formative years of my childhood. Before finally moving in the middle of freshmen year of high school and reaching to California state where I currently reside. Also, at that time I lived in the peninsula near South San Francisco before moving to Dublin/Pleasonton last year after my brother finished going to high school.</p>
