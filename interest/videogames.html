    <h1>Video Gaming</h1>
    <p>I've been an avid gamer since my childhood and it was a core part of my life before getting busy in college. I will be answering questions related to my journey of how I started playing video games, how modding video game consoles led me to studying computer science and much more. Unfortunately, I no longer have the time or leisure to enjoy playing video games as the stress of school and work prevents me from being mentally relaxed enough to play video games. And even if I could retire now, I feel like I've picked up so many hobbies in college at this point that I wouldn't even really want to return back to gaming that much in the first place. </p>

            <td>My earliest memories in my childhood were playing on the Wii console. But my dad claims that it was the original Xbox console however he used it to play media instead of gaming as we barely owned any games for that console and I didn't remember playing any of those games.</td>

            <td>What's your favorite game of all times?</td>
            <td>Destiny 1 was my favorite game which I have to admit-- I was addicted to it. Everyday I would go on to grind and the gameplay loop was so satisfying to return to.</td>

            <td>What video game genres have you played and liked?</td>
            <td>I first started with playing Lego Video Games in my childhood before switching to FPS games in middle school, RPGs in high school, and JRPGs in college.</td>

            <td>How did video games lead you to Computer Science?</td>
            <td>Me learning to mod my video game consoles to pirate games is what led me to first using a terminal shell and understanding how programs fell under the file directory hierarchy.</td>

            <td>Easiest and most difficult consoles you've modded?</td>
            <td>I still have not successfully modded a Wii U as I almost bricked one and I have no idea how to fix it. The easiest console I've modded was the ps vita and is what I have the most experience with as I've done it multiple times.</td>

            <td>Console or PC master race?</td>
            <td>Even tho I have a beefy rtx 3080 desktop handed down from my brother, I still always go back to my console bc it's setup to immediately play and I don't have to keep tweaking around with the pc game settings.</td>

            <tr>
            <td>What do you value in a videogame?</td>
            <td>I value first graphics, story-telling, music, and gameplay in that order. If I'm playing an open world western rpg, then I value the graphics more. But if I'm playing a JRPG, I care more about the aspects more as graphics in this genre are not a priority.</td>

            <tr>
            <td>What is your favorite game franchise series</td>
            <td>My favorite series is the Legend of Heroes: Trails franchise by Nihon Falcom. It has the most world building lore I've ever seen and I still can't believe that each game since 2004 follows each other with the same continuity timeline in universe.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>What is your favorite console or generation?</td>
            <td>My favorite console of all times is the ps vita, I believe it had so much potential but the phone market and proprietary ps vita sd cards ruined it. My favorite generation will always be the latest one that's out now that backwards compatibility is a guarantee going forward and I'm really into better graphical visual fidelity in my games.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>What's on your backlog? Any games you're looking forward to playing?</td>
            <td>I'm looking forward to more games in the Trails series getting translated before I return back to playing that game franchise. I also have a lot of exclusive games that I want to play on the ps5 such as The Last of Us, God of War, and Ghost of Tsushima since I want to experience the dualsense controller features of adaptive triggers and haptic feedback.</td>
